# PQCToday Hub E2E Tests

## Overview
This suite implements strict E2E testing for the `pqctoday-hub` using Playwright, focusing on the Action-State-Result (ASR) architecture. We bypass brittle UI scraper interactions and assert directly on the application's core state engines.

## Methodology: Action-State-Result (ASR)
Our E2E tests adhere to the ASR interaction pattern:
1. **Action**: Tests programmatically dispatch actions directly to React application scopes via `__e2e` window bindings or deep-linking.
2. **State**: Business logic executes seamlessly without manual interaction (eliminating timeout flakes).
3. **Result**: Tests assert that LocalStorage updates, Zustand persists, or the DOM structurally rerenders based strictly on new app state.

## Core Suites

| Suite | Focus | ASR Bypassing Technique |
|-------|-------|-------------------------|
| `acvp-validator.spec.ts` | HSM/WASM crypto processing | Route deep-linking & `__e2e_trigger_acvp` dispatch |
| `accessibility.spec.ts` | WCAG & DOM trapping traps | `window.__e2e_toggle_panel()` to skip mount animations |
| `embed*.spec.ts` | Cross-origin IFrames | Network proxying and test harness routing without clicks |
| `gamification.spec.ts` | Assessment ingestion | Direct mock object injection to `onComplete()` overrides |
| `onboarding.spec.ts` | Learning routing logic | Zustand JSON payload injection to `localStorage` hydration |
| `rag-pipeline.spec.ts` | Langchain Gen-AI API | `window.e2e_chat_send()` combined with HTTP stubbing |
