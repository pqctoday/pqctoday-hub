 * Persona-overwhelm audit acceptance — the headline goal of the 2026-05-22
 * audit (`pqctoday-priv/docs/platform/ux/page-audits/2026-05-22-persona-overwhelm/compliance.md`):
 *
 *   Returning Finance executive sees ≤ 5 top-level rows above the tab bar.
 *
 * Unit tests in `src/components/Compliance/ComplianceView.test.tsx` cover the
 * equivalent jsdom logic. This spec asserts the same claim against a real
 * browser viewport — important because the row-count assertion depends on
 * CSS-resolved DOM structure (`md:hidden`/`hidden md:block`) that jsdom
 * cannot evaluate.
 *
 * RETIRED 2026-08-12 — the second acceptance criterion, "the persona-hint CTA
 * navigates to ?tab=certification with ?rtab=fips", tested a surface the
 * compliance redesign deliberately removed: the persona jump-links retired
 * along with the onboarding stack, and the landing tab is now chosen by
 * `defaultTabForPersona` rather than by a Finance→certification hint.
 * `PersonaHintCta.tsx` went with it.
 *
 * The test outlived the feature by one release. It merged red because the full
 * e2e suite runs nightly rather than per-PR, so nothing failed at the gate —
 * worth remembering when retiring any other surface that has a spec pinned to
 * it. The row-budget test below still earns its keep: it is the assertion that
 * the page stays reduced, which the redesign was for.
