## Cryptographic Disclaimer

This application uses WebAssembly builds of `liboqs` and OpenSSL. While these libraries are industry standards, the WASM implementation in this browser-based environment is intended for **educational and testing purposes**.

**Do not use keys generated in this playground for production systems.** Side-channel attacks and other browser-based vulnerabilities may compromise key material.
