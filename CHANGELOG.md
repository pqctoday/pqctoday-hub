# Changelog

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD024 -->

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.30.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- **Persona-aware assessment report** (`/assess`): Executive persona now sees a streamlined report —
  HNDL/HNFL risk windows and algorithm migration matrix are hidden by default, recommended actions
  are clamped to top 5. A "View full technical report" toggle reveals the complete report.
  Researcher and architect personas get the Industry Threat Landscape section expanded by default.

- **Wizard pre-fill from persona store** (`/assess`): The assessment wizard now auto-fills industry
  and country from the persona/region selections made on the landing page, so users don't re-enter
  data they already provided.

- **Industry filter on Migrate catalog** (`/migrate`): New Industry dropdown filter in the software
  catalog, powered by each product's `targetIndustries` field. Auto-initialized from the
  assessment's industry, persona store, or `?industry=` URL parameter. Includes a filter banner
  with clear button matching the existing layer/step filter pattern.

- **Assessment → Migrate deep link** (`/assess`): "Explore" links on recommended actions pointing
  to `/migrate` now append `?industry=...` so the Migrate catalog auto-filters to industry-relevant
  tools.

## [1.29.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- **Industry-weighted composite scoring** (`/assess`): Risk scores now use industry-tailored
  category weights — government and finance boost regulatory pressure (0.30), telecom and energy
  boost migration complexity (0.25), and technology boosts organizational readiness (0.30) — instead
  of fixed weights across all industries.

- **Country planning horizons** (`/assess`): HNDL and HNFL risk windows now use country-specific
  regulatory deadlines (US/France/Canada target 2030, Germany/UK/Australia target 2035) instead of
  a universal 2035 planning horizon. Users in countries with earlier deadlines see more urgent risk
  assessments.

- **Compliance deadline-aware scoring** (`/assess`): Regulatory pressure scoring now parses actual
  deadline years from compliance frameworks. Passed deadlines score 15 points, imminent (≤2 years)
  score 14, near-term (≤5 years) score 12, and distant deadlines score 8 — replacing the previous
  flat per-framework scoring.

- **Category score driver explanations** (`/assess`): Each of the four risk category progress bars
  now shows a human-readable explanation of what drives the score (e.g., "3 vulnerable algorithms,
  high sensitivity, 25-year retention").

- **Industry-specific recommended actions** (`/assess`): Nine industry-tailored actions added —
  from CNSA 2.0 alignment for government to SCADA/OT assessment for energy, V2X planning for
  automotive, and cloud KMS evaluation for technology.

- **Algorithm-highlighted threat landscape** (`/assess`): Threat rows matching the user's selected
  algorithms are now visually highlighted with a primary-colored left border and subtle background.

- **Country-aware migration roadmap** (`/assess`): Roadmap swim lane phases (Immediate, Short-term,
  Long-term) now dynamically compress or expand based on deadline proximity — urgent deadlines
  (≤24 months) compress to 0–3/3–12 months, distant deadlines (≥60 months) expand to 0–12/12–24
  months.

- **Industry-aware retention defaults** (`/assess`): "I don't know" retention answers now use
  industry-specific conservative defaults from CSV data (75 years for government, 40 for aerospace)
  instead of a flat 15-year default.

### Changed

- **Methodology modal accuracy** (`/assess`): Updated risk score description to reflect actual
  industry-tailored weights and deadline proximity scoring. Added country planning horizon context
  to HNDL description. Updated "I don't know" section with industry-specific retention defaults.

- **Country urgency scoring uncapped** (`/assess`): Removed the artificial cap on country regulatory
  urgency contribution, allowing high-urgency countries (US, France) to contribute their full
  weight to the regulatory pressure score.

- **Executive summary country context** (`/assess`): When a user's country has an accelerated
  planning horizon, the executive summary now explicitly mentions the country's target year
  relative to the global planning horizon.

## [1.28.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- **Report methodology modal** (`/assess`): Info button next to the report title opens a modal
  explaining how the risk score, four risk categories, HNDL/HNFL risk windows, conservative
  defaults for "I don't know" responses, and action prioritization work. Hidden in print view.

### Fixed

- **Compliance impact industry filtering** (`/assess`): Fixed bug where telecom-only compliance
  frameworks (e.g., GSMA NG.116) appeared in Finance industry reports. Changing industry or country
  now clears stale compliance selections, and the scoring engine filters out frameworks that don't
  match the selected industry.

## [1.27.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- **Web Browsers category in Migrate catalog** (`/migrate`): Added Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge,
  Mozilla Firefox, and Apple Safari (CSC-037) with ML-KEM TLS 1.3 support details. All four tagged
  for both migrate and launch phases. New `02222026.csv` created per CSV maintenance rules.

### Changed

- **Three-tier FIPS validation badge** (`/migrate`): FIPS column now distinguishes between
  FIPS 140/203 certified (green "Validated"), indirect or partial claims like FedRAMP, WebTrust,
  FIPS mode (amber "Partial"), and no validation (gray "No"). Previously any "Yes" value showed
  a misleading green "Validated" badge.

### Fixed

- **CSV line ending normalization**: Fixed mixed CRLF/LF line endings in software reference CSVs
  that caused PapaParse to silently drop rows with quoted comma fields.

## [1.26.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- **Sources button on Compliance page** (`/compliance`): Page header now includes a `SourcesButton`
  giving users direct access to authoritative sources referenced in the compliance landscape.

- **Full header cluster on Migrate page** (`/migrate`): The PQC Migration Catalog page header now
  includes an `ArrowRightLeft` icon, plus `SourcesButton`, `ShareButton`, and `GlossaryButton`,
  completing the standard content-page header pattern across all major views.

- **Share & Glossary buttons on OpenSSL Studio** (`/openssl`): Desktop header now includes
  `ShareButton` and `GlossaryButton` (hidden on mobile), consistent with other tool pages.

### Changed

- **Authoritative sources data model** (`src/data/authoritativeSourcesData.ts`): Added
  `complianceCsv` and `migrateCsv` boolean fields to `AuthoritativeSource`; extended `ViewType`
  to include `'Compliance'` and `'Migrate'`; CSV parser updated to 13 columns with
  `lastVerifiedDate` shifted from index 10 to index 12.

### Fixed

- **Playground page layout** (`/playground`): Description paragraph moved above the button cluster
  so it reads correctly before the action controls rather than inline with them.

## [1.25.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- **Persona-aware journey step rail** (`/`): The landing page now features a horizontal 7-step
  progression rail — Learn → Assess → Explore → Test → Deploy → Ramp Up → Stay Agile —
  replacing the previous feature-grid layout. Inaccessible steps are dimmed at 35% opacity
  based on the active persona; persona-priority steps receive a "For you" badge. Each step card
  shows route chips for all paths (Explore → Timeline / Algorithms / Library; Stay Agile →
  Threats / Leaders; single-path steps show their chip too for visual consistency).

- **Hero messaging refresh** (`/`): Updated hero tagline to "The quantum era is here. Your
  transformation journey starts now." with a new "Your PQC Transformation" headline and
  persona-aware CTA buttons routing each role to its most relevant starting point
  (Executive → Assess, Developer → Playground, Architect → Timeline, Researcher → Algorithms).

### Fixed

- **Landing — path chips on all step cards** (`/`): Route chips previously only rendered on
  multi-path steps (`step.paths.length > 1` guard removed). All 7 journey cards now display
  their chips, giving every step a consistent visual affordance.

- **Landing — step rail connector alignment** (`/`): Vertical connector lines between step circles
  now pin correctly to circle center regardless of card column height (fixed via `items-start` +
  `mt-4` offset on the connector div).

- **Tests — ComplianceView and audit_suci** (`src/`): Resolved pre-existing failures by wrapping
  `render()` calls in `<MemoryRouter>`, correcting the default-tab assertion (`"landscape"` not
  `"all"`), adding `Buffer` to the WASM test `vm` context, and replacing `new Function()` with
  `vm.runInContext()` for safer WASM glue code loading.

## [1.24.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- **Entropy & Randomness quiz category** (`/learn/quiz`): New `entropy-randomness` category with Dice icon covering SP 800-90 A/B/C, DRBG mechanisms, entropy sources, TRNG vs QRNG, and min-entropy estimation. Integrated into Developer, Architect, and Researcher learning personas — quiz paths and checkpoint categories updated; estimated path minutes increased accordingly.

- **BB84 simulator — configurable Eve interception rate** (`/learn`): Eve eavesdropping is no longer all-or-nothing. A slider (10%–100%) controls the fraction of qubits Eve intercepts, enabling partial-eavesdropping experiments that show how QBER scales with interception probability. `BB84Service` gains `eveInterceptionRate` and `channelNoise` parameters; `runFullProtocol` and `createInitialState` updated accordingly.

- **QKD deployment explorer — 2 new US deployments** (`/learn`): Added AWS Center for Quantum Networking (CQN) — Amazon's research initiative focused on quantum memory, repeaters, and scalable networking toward a global quantum internet — and the Chicago Quantum Exchange (CQE) 111 km fiber network connecting UChicago, Argonne National Laboratory, and Toshiba, demonstrating multi-node entanglement distribution.

- **Entropy & Randomness module — FIPS 203/204 seed requirements** (`/learn`): New callout section documents that ML-KEM (FIPS 203) requires exactly 32 bytes of full entropy for `d` and `z` seeds, ML-DSA (FIPS 204) requires 32 bytes for `ρ`, `ρ'`, and `K` seeds, and that per SP 800-131A Rev 3 the RBG security strength must match the target PQC security category (e.g., 256-bit RBG for ML-KEM-1024 Category 5). Also added LMS/XMSS stateful signature entropy failure note and XOF_DRBG (SHAKE-based, SP 800-90A Rev 2) to the DRBG mechanism comparison.

- **Standards Library — 4 new records** (`/library`): RFC 9258 (TLS 1.3 external PSK importer for QKD key injection), NIST SP 800-108 Rev 1 (KDF using PRFs — counter, feedback, and double-pipeline modes; PKCS#11 `CKM_SP800_108_COUNTER_KDF`), NIST SP 800-56C Rev 2 (key derivation for key-establishment including hybrid QKD+PQC EtE), and PKCS#11 v3.0 OASIS Standard (`CKM_HKDF_DERIVE`, `CKM_SP800_108_COUNTER_KDF`, `CKM_HKDF_KEY_GEN`). All tagged with `qkd`, `key-management`, `hybrid-crypto`, or `tls-basics` cross-references.

- **ScoreCard — scoring transparency modal** (`/`): An info button (ⓘ) on the Learning Journey ScoreCard opens a `ScoringModal` explaining the four weighted dimensions: Knowledge (40%), Breadth (30%), Practice (20%), and Time & Consistency (10%), with belt thresholds displayed for each rank.

### Fixed

- **Security — Assessment URL parameter injection** (`/assess`): URL-hydrated state (industry, country, algorithms, compliance frameworks, use cases, infrastructure) is now validated against allowlists derived from the canonical `assessmentData` constants and `REGION_COUNTRIES_MAP`. Arbitrary values injected via shared assessment URLs are silently discarded rather than written to the store.

- **Security — XSS-safe global error overlay** (`src/main.tsx`): Replaced `innerHTML`-based error display with safe DOM construction (`textContent` / `createElement`). Handler is now gated behind `import.meta.env.DEV` so it is completely absent from production bundles.

- **Security — OpenSSL worker eval() removal** (`/openssl`): The `fetch()+eval()` fallback path in the WASM script loader has been replaced with a hard fail and descriptive error message. The worker is a Classic Worker and must use `importScripts`; silent eval was a supply-chain risk and is now gone.

## [1.23.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- **Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) Learning Module** (`/learn`): New module with three workshop
  parts — (1) Interactive BB84 protocol simulator with configurable qubit count (8/16/32) and
  toggleable Eve eavesdropper for eavesdropping detection demos, (2) Post-processing visualization
  covering error correction, privacy amplification, and hybrid key derivation, and (3) Global QKD
  deployment explorer with real-world adoption data. Includes Learn, Workshop, Exercises, and
  References tabs. Fully integrated with InlineTooltip glossary, time-spent tracking, and the
  Learning Journey scorecard.

- **Compliance Landscape Dashboard** (`/compliance`): New interactive compliance visualization
  with a 2024–2036 deadline timeline (urgency-coded: imminent/near-term/future), framework cards
  showing PQC requirements, region/industry chips, and cross-references to Library and Timeline.
  Persona integration pre-selects relevant region/industry filters. Includes summary stats (total
  frameworks, PQC-required count, deadline count) and expandable framework detail with related
  documents.

- **Four new UI components** (`src/components/ui/`): `<Skeleton>` (pulse loading placeholder),
  `<EmptyState>` (icon/title/description/action), `<ErrorAlert>` (retry-capable error display),
  and `<CategoryBadge>` (region/industry/level semantic badge). All use semantic tokens only and
  fulfill missing component entries from `docs/ux-standard.md`.

- **Assessment wizard modularized**: The 13-step risk assessment wizard is now split into
  dedicated step components (`src/components/Assess/steps/`) — one file per step — improving
  maintainability and enabling independent testing. Steps include multi-select fields for data
  sensitivity, retention, and credential lifetime with consistent "Unknown" escape-hatch buttons.

- **Assessment data layer extracted**: Scoring logic, type definitions (`AssessmentInput`,
  `HNDLRiskWindow`, `HNFLRiskWindow`), and algorithm database extracted into
  `src/hooks/assessmentData.ts`, `assessmentTypes.ts`, and `assessmentUtils.ts` for cleaner
  separation of concerns and reuse across wizard steps.

- **UX design system documentation** (`docs/`): Added `ux-standard.md` (full semantic token
  standard, component contracts, page header conventions) and `ux-gap-analysis.md` (current
  violations inventory and remediation backlog).

- **Compliance CSV** (`src/data/compliance_02222026.csv`): New date-stamped compliance framework
  dataset with framework metadata, deadlines, regions, industries, PQC requirements, and
  cross-references. Auto-discovered by `complianceData.ts` via `import.meta.glob`.

## [1.22.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- **Persona-filtered quiz** (`/learn/quiz`): Quiz questions now carry a `personas` tag (CSV column).
  When a learning persona is active, the quiz module filters questions and dynamically recomputes
  category metadata (question counts, available categories) so each persona sees only relevant
  content. Quick, Full, and Category modes all respect the active persona filter.

- **Glossary expansion** (`/learn`): Added 24 new glossary terms covering TLS (cipher suites,
  handshake), VPN/SSH (Rosenpass, sntrup761), email signing (SignedData, EnvelopedData,
  KEMRecipientInfo), key management (PKCS#11, key lifecycle), stateful signatures (Merkle tree,
  Winternitz OTS), digital assets (P2PKH, BIP44), 5G security (ECIES, AUSF, SIDF, UDM), and
  digital identity (PID, Relying Party, Wallet Instance Attestation). Enriched ~40 existing terms
  with `relatedModule` deep links to learning modules.

- **Glossary button in Learn header** (`/learn`): Added the `GlossaryButton` component to the
  `PKILearningView` header bar, accessible from both the dashboard and individual module views.

## [1.21.1] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- **Simulated Hybrid KEM in Hybrid Crypto Workshop** (`/learn`): X25519MLKEM768 is not available as
  a standalone `genpkey` algorithm in the OpenSSL WASM build. The workshop now simulates hybrid KEM
  by running X25519 ECDH (Web Crypto API) and ML-KEM-768 (OpenSSL WASM) as separate operations, then
  combining shared secrets via HKDF-Extract (SHA-256). The KEM demo shows side-by-side cards for pure
  PQC (ML-KEM-768) and hybrid (X25519 + ML-KEM-768) with component secret breakdown (PQC secret,
  classical secret, combined HKDF secret) and per-phase timing. Key generation step produces separate
  X25519 and ML-KEM-768 keys with combined PEM output.

### Fixed

- **Hybrid Crypto WASM file persistence** (`/learn`): All HybridCryptoService methods now correctly
  pass file data between OpenSSL WASM calls. Previously, key files, ciphertext, and signatures were
  lost between `openSSLService.execute()` invocations because each call creates a fresh WASM
  instance. Fixes ML-DSA-65 certificate generation ("No such file or directory") and KEM
  encapsulation/decapsulation failures.

- **Complete Module button visibility** (`/learn`): The "Complete Module" button now correctly
  appears on the last step of all learning modules including Quantum Threats and Hybrid Crypto.
  Previously the button was hidden on the final step due to an off-by-one check.

- **Composite certificate generation** (`/learn`): Fixed CompositeCertificateViewer to pass key file
  data when generating self-signed certificates, resolving "Could not open file" errors for both
  ECDSA P-256 and ML-DSA-65 certificates.

- **Library detail modal on mobile** (`/library`): Made the document detail modal responsive on
  mobile devices with proper layout and scrolling.

## [1.21.0] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- **7-layer Enterprise Infrastructure Stack**: Restructured the Migrate module from 5 layers to 7
  distinct architectural tiers — Cloud, Network, Application Servers & Software, Database, Security
  Stack, Operating System, Hardware & Secure Elements. Each layer has a dedicated icon, color
  scheme, and descriptive subtitle. Products can now span multiple layers via comma-separated values
  (e.g., AWS KMS appears under both Cloud and Security Stack), with the filter, table icon, and
  layer label column all supporting multi-layer display.

- **Security Stack layer with 42 products**: New dedicated layer for security-critical
  infrastructure covering KMS, PKI, Crypto Libraries, Certificate Lifecycle Management, Secrets
  Management, IAM, Data Protection, and CIAM. Includes Venafi, Keyfactor, HashiCorp Vault, Okta,
  Keycloak, Auth0, ForgeRock, DigiCert, Sectigo, Thales CipherTrust DSP, IBM Guardium, Virtru,
  and core cryptographic libraries (OpenSSL, Bouncy Castle, liboqs, wolfSSL, Google Tink, AWS-LC).

- **30+ new product entries across 10 categories**: Cloud KMS (AWS, Google, Azure), Cloud HSM
  (Thales Luna, AWS CloudHSM, Azure Dedicated HSM), QRNG (ID Quantique Quantis, Quantinuum Quantum
  Origin, QuintessenceLabs), QKD (ID Quantique Cerberis, Toshiba QKD, Quantum Bridge), Network
  Encryptors (Thales HSE, Senetas CN7000, Adva FSP 3000, Ciena WaveLogic 6), Confidential
  Computing (Intel TDX, AMD SEV-SNP, ARM CCA), IAM (Okta, Keycloak, Ping Identity), CIAM (Auth0,
  ForgeRock), Data Protection (Thales CipherTrust DSP, IBM Guardium, Virtru), and Certificate
  Lifecycle Management (DigiCert, Sectigo, EJBCA).

- **PQC Support filter**: Replaced the Platform dropdown with a PQC Support filter that normalizes
  the detailed capability strings into four broad groups — Yes, Limited, Planned, No — so users can
  instantly find products with production-ready quantum-safe capabilities versus those still on the
  roadmap.

- **Contextual filter cascading**: Category and PQC Support dropdowns now derive their available
  options from the currently filtered dataset. Selecting a layer automatically reduces the Category
  dropdown to only categories present in that layer, and vice versa. Stale selections auto-reset to
  "All" when they become unavailable.

### Changed

- **Reference Catalog renamed**: "Software Reference Catalog" heading renamed to "Reference
  Catalog", "Software" column renamed to "Product", "View Related Software" button renamed to "View
  Related Products", and "Software Coverage Gaps" renamed to "Coverage Gaps" throughout the Migrate
  module.

- **193 total products** (up from 161), with multi-layer overlap bringing effective per-layer
  counts to: Cloud 24, Network 13, Application 86, Database 6, Security Stack 42, OS 7,
  Hardware 27.

### Fixed

- **CSV data quality audit**: Consolidated redundant PKI category (CSC-020 merged into CSC-004),
  removed duplicate HashiCorp Vault row, corrected Palo Alto PAN-OS layer assignment from OS to
  Network to match its NGFW peer group.

- **Thales Luna Cloud HSM accuracy**: Corrected PQC support from "Yes (ML-KEM ML-DSA FIPS 140-3
  L3)" to "No (PQC roadmap pending)" and FIPS validation from "FIPS 140-3 L3" to "FIPS 140-2 L3"
  based on current product capabilities.

## [1.20.0] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- **HNFL concept in PQC 101**: The introductory module now covers both harvest-now attack models
  side-by-side. A new "Key concept: HNFL" panel in Step 1 explains that "Harvest Now, Forge Later"
  targets **authenticity and integrity** — adversaries capture signed artifacts (firmware images,
  certificate chains, code-signing blobs) today and retroactively forge or repudiate those
  signatures once a CRQC exists. This contrasts with HNDL (which targets confidentiality). The
  "Digital signatures & code signing" risk bullet now surfaces the HNFL label as a forward
  reference, and Exercise 2 has been reframed to ask learners to distinguish both threat models and
  the algorithm families (ML-DSA/SLH-DSA for HNFL, ML-KEM for HNDL) that address each.

## [1.19.0] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- **Expanded quantum threat dataset (80 threats, 20 industries)**: The Quantum Threats module now
  draws from an updated dataset covering Aerospace/Aviation, Automotive/Connected Vehicles, Cloud
  Computing, Cryptocurrency/Blockchain, Energy/Critical Infrastructure, Financial Services,
  Government/Defense, Healthcare, Insurance, IoT, IT/Software, Legal/eSignature, Media/DRM,
  Payment Card Industry, Rail/Transit, Retail/E-Commerce, Supply Chain/Logistics,
  Telecommunications, and Water/Wastewater — each with criticality rating, vulnerable algorithms,
  PQC replacement recommendation, and primary source citations.
- **Expanded global PQC timeline**: Timeline updated with new milestones through February 2026
  including DoD/SandboxAQ AQtive Guard deployment (Pentagon 5-year contract), Ethereum Foundation
  PQC security initiative ($2M research prize pool, Jan 2026), CISA federal PQC procurement
  guidance (Jan 2026, pursuant to EO 14306), G7 financial sector PQC roadmap (Jan 2026,
  U.S. Treasury + Bank of England), National Quantum Initiative reauthorization (Jan 2026),
  Samsung/Thales ML-KEM embedded secure element (Jan 2026), Australia ASD migration deadlines
  (2026–2030), Canada departmental planning deadlines (2026–2031), China NGCC program and
  financial sector milestones (2025–2030), EU coordinated PQC roadmap milestones (2026–2035),
  France ANSSI first PQC certifications (Sept–Oct 2025), and Germany BSI quantum-secure
  demonstrator (Nov 2025).

### Changed

- **Transformation Leaders updated to 100 verified profiles**: Dataset refreshed with corrections
  and new additions including Philip Intallura (HSBC Group Head Quantum Technologies), Dr. Krysta
  Svore (NVIDIA, former Microsoft Azure Quantum VP), Niccolò De Masi (IonQ Chairman & CEO),
  Bruno Couillard (Crypto4A, pioneer of crypto-agile HSMs), Denis Mandich (Qrypt, 20 years US
  Intelligence Community), Éric Brier (Thales, FALCON algorithm co-designer), Dr. Bob Sutor
  (Sutor Group, former IBM VP Quantum, 40+ years at IBM), Prof. Bill Buchanan OBE (Edinburgh
  Napier, Stanford top 2% scientists 2025), Dr. Colin Soutar (Deloitte Global Quantum Cyber
  Readiness Lead), Konstantinos Karagiannis (Protiviti Director Quantum Computing Services),
  Sheetal Mehta (NTT DATA SVP Global Head of Cybersecurity), and Tom Patterson (Accenture
  Managing Director Emerging Technology Security).
- **Software reference corrected — Google Cloud HSM now shows PQC support**: Google Cloud HSM
  entry updated to reflect that PQC key types (ML-KEM, ML-DSA, SLH-DSA, X-Wing) are available
  through Cloud KMS with HSM protection level. Previous entry incorrectly listed PQC as
  unavailable.

## [1.18.1] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- **Consistent "I don't know" UX across all wizard steps**: Steps 6 (Migration Status), 11 (Crypto
  Agility), and 14 (Timeline Pressure) now use the same dashed-border escape-hatch button pattern
  as Step 3. Previously these three steps embedded "Don't Know" as a regular radio option
  indistinguishable from substantive answers.
- **Consolidated HNDL / HNFL Risk Windows section in report**: The two separate risk window panels
  are now unified into a single "Harvest-Now Attack Risk Windows" section with a **Key Milestones**
  table at the top (Today, Estimated CRQC, Data/Credential expiry dates with at-risk / safe badges)
  followed by the individual timeline visualizations.
- **HNDL / HNFL risk windows for "I don't know" users**: When users select "I don't know" on the
  Data Retention or Credential Lifetime steps, the report now shows risk window visualizations using
  conservative defaults (15-year retention, 10-year credential lifetime) with "(estimated)" labels
  and guidance to define policies for a precise assessment. Previously these sections were invisible
  when the user didn't know their values.

### Changed

- **"I don't know" scoring treats unknowns as high risk**: All "don't know" inputs are now scored
  conservatively rather than as low/moderate risk:
  - Crypto agility unknown: 0.7 &rarr; 0.9 (same as hardcoded)
  - Timeline pressure unknown: 1.1&times; &rarr; 1.2&times; (near-term pressure assumed)
  - Sensitivity unknown: treated as "high" (was implicitly "low")
  - Retention unknown: 12pts retention score (was 0)
  - Infrastructure unknown: 15pts complexity (was 10)
  - Vendor dependency unknown: treated as heavy-vendor (was mixed)

## [1.18.0] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- **"I don't know" escape hatches in Risk Assessment wizard**: Six wizard steps now include explicit
  uncertainty options, ensuring users who lack complete information can still complete the assessment:
  - **Step 3 (Current Crypto)**: "I don't know / Not sure" chip clears algorithm selections and
    triggers conservative RSA-2048 + ECDH equivalent scoring in the engine; all algorithm chips dim
    while active. Wizard cannot advance without at least one algorithm selected _or_ the unknown flag set.
  - **Step 5 (Compliance)**: "None apply / I don't know" button clears all selected frameworks
    (optional step — no blocking).
  - **Step 7 (Use Cases)**: Styled "I don't know / None of these" button replaces the old plain text
    skip hint (optional step — no blocking).
  - **Step 8 (Data Retention)**: "I don't know / Not sure" chip clears retention selections;
    engine falls back to sensitivity-based HNDL estimate. Wizard requires at least one selection
    _or_ the unknown flag before advancing.
  - **Step 11 (Infrastructure)**: Styled "None of these / I don't know" button (optional step —
    no blocking).
  - **Step 12 (Vendors)**: "I don't know / Not sure" button clears vendor selection and defaults
    engine to `mixed` dependency weighting. Wizard requires a selection _or_ the unknown flag.
- **Compliance framework descriptions in Step 5**: Each compliance framework button now shows
  a description sub-line — industry-specific frameworks use their config description; universal
  frameworks (NIST, NIS2, etc.) show the deadline and first sentence of regulatory notes.
- **Awareness-gap remediation actions**: When a user answers "I don't know" on any wizard step,
  the assessment report automatically surfaces targeted recommended actions at the top of the
  priority list to help close those knowledge gaps — e.g. "Conduct a cryptographic asset inventory"
  for unknown algorithms, "Establish a data retention policy" for unknown retention, etc. Covers
  unknown crypto, unknown retention, unknown vendors, missing compliance selections, missing use
  cases, and missing infrastructure data.
- **Quick Assessment executive summary**: Quick assessments (steps 1–6 only) now produce a
  concise executive summary paragraph in the report, summarising risk level, vulnerable algorithms,
  compliance pressure, and migration status. Previously only comprehensive assessments had this.
- **Quick/Comprehensive badge in report header**: A small pill badge in the report header identifies
  whether the result came from a Quick or Comprehensive assessment.
- **HNDL warning banner for quick assessments**: When a quick assessment is completed with
  `high` or `critical` data sensitivity, a warning banner appears in the report noting that
  Harvest-Now-Decrypt-Later risk was not quantified (data retention was not collected) and
  recommending a comprehensive assessment.
- **Country-aware regulatory pressure scoring**: The compound engine now incorporates a
  `COUNTRY_REGULATORY_URGENCY` map (14 jurisdictions) so selecting a country with active
  PQC mandates (e.g. United States, France) increases the Regulatory Pressure category score.
  The legacy quick path also receives a country boost proportional to the urgency weight.
- **`requiresPQC: null` third state for unrecognised compliance frameworks**: Compliance
  frameworks not in the database now surface as "Status unknown" (grey badge) rather than
  "No PQC mandate yet" (which was misleading). The report's compliance impact panel handles
  all three states: `true` (PQC Required / amber), `null` (Status unknown / grey),
  `false` (No PQC mandate yet / grey).

### Changed

- **Risk thresholds recalibrated**: Low/Medium/High/Critical boundaries moved from 30/60/80 to
  25/55/75. This better reflects the distribution of real scores — fewer organisations
  incorrectly land in "Low" and the "Critical" band triggers sooner for high-exposure profiles.
- **NIS2 deadline text updated**: The NIS2 Directive entry now reads
  "October 2024 (transposition passed — enforcement underway)" to reflect that the transposition
  deadline has passed and enforcement is active across the EU.
- **Assessment stale threshold extended**: In-progress (incomplete) wizard sessions are now
  preserved for 30 days before being auto-reset (previously 7 days), reducing accidental
  loss of partially-completed assessments.

## [1.17.5] - 2026-02-21

### Changed

- **Dependency upgrades**: Merged 4 Dependabot updates — `@vitest/coverage-v8` 4.0.18,
  `eslint-plugin-react-refresh` 0.5.0, `jsdom` 28.1.0, `eslint-plugin-security` 4.0.0.
- **ESLint config for security plugin v4**: Adapted flat config to manually extract plugins and
  rules from `security.configs.recommended` to avoid circular reference crash in `defineConfig()`.
- **Updated SBOM**: Refreshed 9 dependency versions in About page to match actual installed
  (React 19.2.4, Framer Motion 12.34.2, Tailwind CSS 4.2.0, tailwind-merge 3.5.0,
  React Router 7.13.0, Zustand 5.0.11, Prettier 3.8.1, Vitest 4.0.18, Playwright 1.58.2).
- **Security audit date**: Bumped to February 21, 2026 (same findings — 13 dev-only, 0 production).

### Fixed

- **Persona "For you" badge**: `setPersona` no longer resets `suppressSuggestion` to false,
  preventing the assessment-inferred badge from reappearing after selecting then clearing a role.

## [1.17.4] - 2026-02-20

### Added

- **Persona-aware guided tour**: The first-visit onboarding tour now filters steps to only highlight
  features visible in the active persona's navigation — an Executive won't be shown the Playground
  or OpenSSL Studio steps.
- **Persona-aware hero CTAs**: Landing page primary and secondary call-to-action buttons now adapt
  to the selected role — Executives are directed to Risk Assessment, Developers to the Playground,
  Architects to the Migration Timeline, and Researchers to Algorithm Explorer.
- **"For you" persona badge on landing**: After completing the Risk Assessment, the inferred
  recommended persona is surfaced with a "For you" badge on the home page role picker.
- **Cross-view CTAs**: Assessment report now includes a "Start Learning" link to the persona-matched
  learning path; the learning path panel includes a "Start Assessment" CTA when no assessment has
  been completed.
- **Compliance and Migrate in executive nav**: `/compliance` and `/migrate` added to the Executive
  persona's navigation — assessment report links to both views are no longer dead ends.
- **Assess in developer nav**: `/assess` added to the Developer persona's navigation — the
  algorithm migration matrix in the report is now reachable.
- **Playground in architect nav**: `/playground` added to the Security Architect persona's
  navigation for hands-on PoC algorithm evaluation.

### Changed

- **Persona inference rewritten**: `inferPersonaFromAssessment()` now correctly maps assessment
  answers to all four persona types. Previous implementation used wrong enum values and always
  defaulted to Architect; Researcher was never reachable. Now uses correct field values
  (`not-started`/`started`/`planning`, `fully-abstracted`, etc.) and returns `null` when signal is
  insufficient.
- **Default persona is now null**: First-time visitors see the full navigation (same as Researcher)
  rather than being silently assigned Researcher. "Clear all" in the persona picker now fully resets
  to no selection.
- **Developer learning path expanded**: Added Quantum Threats module (after PQC 101) and Crypto
  Agility module (after Hybrid Crypto). Path now includes a 4th checkpoint and grows from 405 to
  495 estimated minutes.
- **Architect learning path expanded**: Added TLS Basics module (after Hybrid Crypto). Estimated
  time grows from 420 to 465 minutes.
- **Executive quiz categories fixed**: Removed `industry-threats` from quiz pre-selection — the
  corresponding module was never taught in the executive path. Replaced with `crypto-agility` which
  is covered by the Crypto Agility module.
- **Persona order unified**: Role buttons across home page and learn page now follow the same
  order: Executive → Developer → Architect → Researcher.
- **Assessment report link filtering**: "Explore" action links in the assessment report are now
  hidden when they point to a route outside the active persona's navigation — no more dead links.
- **Researcher learning path**: Added 5th checkpoint after the three application modules (Digital
  Assets, 5G Security, Digital ID) for consistent knowledge verification before the final quiz.

## [1.17.3] - 2026-02-20

### Changed

- **Single-select industry**: The industry picker on the home page now works as single-select —
  clicking an industry selects it exclusively; clicking the active industry deselects it (returns
  to All Industries). Previously allowed multi-select.
- **Timeline country dropdown scoped to region**: When a region is selected on the home page,
  the Timeline country filter shows only that region's group and its individual countries
  (Americas → US + Canada, Europe → 8 EU countries, APAC → 8 APAC countries; Global/none shows all).
- **Digital ID learning module**: Finance & Banking added as a relevant industry alongside
  Government & Defense and Healthcare.

## [1.17.2] - 2026-02-20

### Fixed

- **Library industry filter**: Normalized 40+ raw CSV industry aliases (e.g. `Finance`, `Gov`,
  `Telecom`, `Critical Infrastructure`) to the 11 canonical industry names used across the app.
  The industry dropdown now shows clean canonical names instead of 30+ fragmented raw tags.
- **Library persona → filter**: Selecting an industry on the home page now correctly pre-filters
  the Library (was returning 0 results due to vocabulary mismatch between canonical names and CSV tags).
- **Library untagged items**: Documents with no specific industry tag (broadly applicable standards)
  now appear in all industry-filtered views instead of being hidden.

### Changed

- **Assessment country step**: Step 2 (Country) now lists only the countries that belong to the
  region selected on the home page (Americas → US + Canada, Europe → 8 EU countries,
  APAC → 8 APAC countries, Global/none → all countries).
- **Assessment pre-seeding**: Industry and country fields are now seeded from the home page
  persona selection when starting a fresh assessment (no URL params, no in-progress assessment).

## [1.17.1] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- **Mobile Compliance View** (`/compliance`): New dedicated mobile layout with card-based display
  for compliance records, optimized for touch navigation and small screens.
- **Mobile Threats List** (`/threats`): New dedicated mobile layout for the threats dashboard,
  presenting threat cards in a vertically stacked, touch-friendly format.

### Changed

- **Compliance Table tooltips**: PQC mechanism and classical algorithm tooltips now support
  tap-to-toggle on mobile in addition to hover on desktop, replacing the hover-only interaction.
- **Tooltip viewport clamping**: Tooltip width constrained to `min(256px, 100vw-32px)` to prevent
  overflow on small screens.
- **Gantt Detail Popover**: Refactored layout for improved readability and usability on mobile.
- **Filter Dropdown**: Adjusted touch targets for better mobile usability.
- **Personalization Section**: Minor layout refinements for small-screen display.
- **Main Layout**: Navigation adjustments for mobile responsiveness.

## [1.17.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added

- **Personalization Panel** (`/`): New three-dimension picker on the home page lets users set their
  role (Executive, Developer, Architect, Researcher), region (Americas, Europe, APAC, Global),
  and industry (11 sectors) in a single always-editable section below the hero stats bar.
  Selections persist across sessions via localStorage.
- **Persona-driven navigation**: Selecting a role hides irrelevant pages from the nav;
  always-visible pages (Home, Learn, Timeline, Threats, About) remain accessible to all users
  regardless of persona.
- **"For you" card badges**: Landing page feature cards show a "For you" badge for the top 3
  pages most relevant to the active persona.
- **Region pre-seeding**: Selecting a region pre-filters the Timeline on mount and pre-seeds the
  Assessment country field (Americas → United States, Europe → France, APAC → Japan).
- **Industry pre-seeding**: Selecting an industry pre-seeds the Assessment industry field,
  pre-filters the Threats dashboard, adds an industry filter chip row to the Library, and
  highlights relevant Learning modules with a "Relevant" badge.
- **Industry icons**: Each industry chip in the personalization panel now displays a contextual
  icon (e.g. `Landmark` for Finance, `Shield` for Government, `HeartPulse` for Healthcare).
- **"All Industries" chip**: Explicit chip in the industry row to reset to no filter, always
  highlighted when no industry is selected.

### Changed

- **Learn module**: Removed the in-Learn persona picker; learning paths are now driven entirely
  by the home page persona selection. When no persona is set, the full module grid is shown with
  a "Personalize from home" button linking back to the home page.

## [1.16.1] - 2026-02-20

### Added

- **Executive Summary Dashboard** (`/executive`): High-level PQC readiness metrics, organizational risk scores, and priority action items.
- **7 New PKI Learning Modules** (`/learn`): Added new comprehensive interactive courses:
  - Quantum Threats (HNDL Timeline, Algorithm Vulnerability)
  - Hybrid Cryptography (Key Generation, Signatures)
  - Crypto Agility & Architecture (Abstraction, CBOM)
  - Stateful Hash Signatures (LMS, XMSS)
  - Email & Document Signing (S/MIME, CMS)
  - VPN/IPsec & SSH
  - Key Management & HSM

### Fixed

- **Time Tracking Analytics** (`/learn`): Replaced erroneous `Date.now()` logic that was previously causing massive `timeSpent` metric inflation. Restored sub-minute `float` state precision to correctly accumulate elapsed time across all 14 learning modules, and applied a clean decimal-mask (`Math.floor()`) during frontend Dashboard render.
- **KeyRotationPlanner Build**: Fixed a strict TS compilation error regarding target algorithms missing data keys.

## [1.16.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added

#### Learning Platform Restructure

- **Learning Platform Restructure** (`/learn`): PKI Workshop, Digital Assets, and 5G Security
  modules restructured to the 3-tab layout (Learn | Simulate | Exercises) established by TLS
  Basics. Each module now separates educational theory from hands-on practice and includes guided
  exercise scenarios with "Load & Run" presets and a Quiz CTA.
- **PKI Workshop** (`/learn/pki-workshop`): New Learn tab with 6 educational sections (What is
  PKI, Certificate Lifecycle with interactive diagram, X.509 Anatomy, Trust Chains & Validation,
  PQC in PKI, CTA). New Exercises tab with 5 guided scenarios (RSA-2048, ECDSA P-256, ML-DSA-44,
  ML-DSA-87, SLH-DSA) that pre-configure the workshop and navigate to the correct step.
- **Digital Assets** (`/learn/digital-assets`): New Learn tab with blockchain cryptography
  introduction covering key generation, address derivation, digital signing, and PQC threat
  analysis per chain. New Exercises tab with guided scenarios for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and
  HD Wallet flows.
- **5G Security** (`/learn/5g-security`): New Learn tab with 6 sections — What is 5G Security
  (3GPP TS 33.501 overview, IMSI catcher history), The Three Pillars (Privacy/Authentication/
  Provisioning), SUCI Protection Schemes (Profile A/B/C comparison), 5G-AKA Authentication
  (MILENAGE f1-f5, key hierarchy), SIM Provisioning & Supply Chain, Post-Quantum Threat to 5G
  (quantum-vulnerable vs quantum-resistant components). New Exercises tab with 5 scenarios
  (Profile A Classical, Profile B NIST, Profile C Hybrid, Profile C Pure PQC, 5G-AKA
  Authentication).

#### Data Expansion

- **Leaders Board Expanded**: 12 new PQC leaders added via `leaders_02202026.csv` — Prof Bill Buchanan OBE (Edinburgh Napier), Dr. Bob Sutor (Sutor Group), Bruno Couillard (Crypto4A), Dr. Colin Soutar (Deloitte), Denis Mandich (Qrypt), Éric Brier (Thales), Konstantinos Karagiannis (Protiviti), Dr. Krysta Svore (Microsoft Azure Quantum), Niccolò De Masi (IonQ), Philip Intallura (HSBC), Sheetal Mehta (NTT DATA), Tom Patterson (Accenture); total now 98 leaders

### Changed

- **Dashboard Progress** (`/learn`): Module progress calculation now uses accurate per-module step
  counts via a `MODULE_STEP_COUNTS` map instead of a hardcoded default of 4 steps. PKI Workshop
  description and duration updated (45 min → 60 min).

### Fixed

- **Algorithm Data**: 10 factual inaccuracies corrected across PQC algorithm profiles
- **Migration Guide**: 5 factual inaccuracies corrected in migration planning content

## [1.15.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added

- **Quiz CSV Data Layer** (`/learn/quiz`): Extracted all quiz questions from hardcoded TypeScript
  into a date-stamped CSV file (`pqcquiz_02192026.csv`), following the established pattern used
  by Leaders, Timeline, Threats, and Library modules. The quiz software auto-selects the most
  recent CSV via `import.meta.glob` in the new `quizDataLoader.ts` loader.
- **Quiz Mode Column** (`/learn/quiz`): New `quiz_mode` field on every question (`quick`, `full`,
  `both`) enables pool-based filtering — Quick Quiz draws from the `quick`+`both` pool (~121
  questions), Full Assessment samples from all 162 questions.
- **Expanded Question Pool** (`/learn/quiz`): Grew from 80 to 162 questions across 8 categories,
  grounded in the app's authoritative data sources (algorithm reference, timeline, threats, and
  learn module content). ~20 questions per category.
- **Smart Sampling with Guaranteed Coverage** (`/learn/quiz`): Both quiz modes now guarantee
  minimum category representation — Quick Quiz: 20 questions with ≥2 per category; Full
  Assessment: 80 questions with ≥10 per category. Every run produces a unique random mix.
- **Source Attribution** (`/learn/quiz`): Quiz intro header displays the source CSV filename and
  last-updated date, consistent with other data-driven pages.

### Changed

- **Full Assessment** (`/learn/quiz`): Changed from "all questions" to an 80-question random
  sample drawn from the full 162-question pool with guaranteed category coverage.
- **Quiz Data Structure** (`/learn/quiz`): `quizData.ts` is now a thin re-export shim; all data
  loading and category metadata live in `quizDataLoader.ts`.

### Fixed

- **Quiz Question Accuracy** (`/learn/quiz`): Applied 7 factual corrections — CNSA 2.0 2030
  scope clarification, EO 14306 date/attribution, Germany's QUANTITY initiative description,
  GSMA PQ.03 v2.0 publication date, Canada CCCS 2026 milestone wording, and a self-contradictory
  TLS hybrid failure explanation.

## [1.14.4] - 2026-02-19

### Added

- **Inline Tooltips** (`/assess`): Jargon terms (HNDL, PQC, Crypto Agility, HSM) in the wizard
  now show click-to-open glossary definitions via a new `InlineTooltip` component backed by 180+
  glossary terms.
- **Quick Assessment Mode** (`/assess`): New mode selector on the landing page — "Quick" (6 steps,
  ~2 min) or "Comprehensive" (13 steps, ~5 min). Quick mode uses the legacy scoring path.
- **Migration Roadmap** (`/assess`): Phased visualization in the report grouping recommended actions
  into 3 swim lanes (0–6 mo, 6–18 mo, 18–36 mo) with effort badges and country deadline indicator.

### Changed

- **Context-Aware Cross-Links** (`/assess`): "Explore" links in recommended actions now carry
  user-specific query params (e.g. `/algorithms?highlight=RSA-2048,ECDH`,
  `/threats?industry=Finance`). Algorithm Transition Guide highlights matching rows; Threats
  Dashboard pre-filters by industry. Migration matrix adds "Try in Playground" links for PQC
  replacement algorithms.
- **Progress Persistence** (`/assess`): Stale assessment threshold extended from 24 hours to 7 days.
  Resume banner shows on return with step info, timestamp, and Continue / Start Over options.

## [1.14.3] - 2026-02-19

### Fixed

- **PDF Print Cross-Browser** (`/assess`): Report PDF now renders correctly in both Chrome and
  Safari. Chrome was not repeating `html { margin-top }` on pages 2+, causing content to overlap
  the fixed header/footer. Replaced with an invisible `<table class="print-report-table">` whose
  `<thead>` (14mm) and `<tfoot>` (10mm) are treated as per-page repeating groups by both browsers.
  All CSS selectors use child combinators (`>`) to avoid cascading into inner report tables.
- **Library Markdown Parser** (`/library`): Fixed markdown rendering regression introduced by
  Prettier reformatting the parser configuration.
- **Security Dependencies** (`deps`): Added `overrides` for `minimatch` and `ajv` to resolve
  high-severity audit findings in transitive dependencies.
- **CI Security Audit** (`ci`): Scoped `npm audit` to production dependencies only, eliminating
  false positives from dev-only packages in the CI pipeline.

## [1.14.2] - 2026-02-19

### Fixed

- **Retention Step Industry-Awareness** (`/assess`): Step 8 (Data Retention) no longer shows
  finance/healthcare-specific language for unrelated industries. Universal time-range options are
  now sourced from the CSV (empty industries column) with purely time-based descriptions.
  Every industry now has specific regulatory retention entries:
  Automotive (telematics 1-3y, vehicle lifetime 10-15y),
  Technology (SOC 2 audit logs 3y),
  Energy & Utilities (NERC CIP-007 3y, FERC/billing 7y),
  Aerospace (FAA/DO-178C aircraft lifetime 20-40y),
  Retail & E-Commerce (PCI DSS audit logs 1y, cardholder data 2y),
  Education (FERPA/financial aid 6y, permanent transcripts).
- **PDF Export** (`/assess`): Reverted to `window.print()` from html2canvas/jsPDF for more
  reliable cross-browser output.

## [1.14.1] - 2026-02-19

### Fixed

- **PDF Content Clipping** (`/assess`): Eliminated content overlap behind the fixed print
  header/footer on pages 2+. Uses invisible `<thead>`/`<tfoot>` spacer table to reserve
  per-page space for the repeating header (14mm) and footer (10mm).
- **Print Visibility** (`GuidedTour`, `WhatsNewToast`): Hidden from print output via `print:hidden`.
- **Threat Table Print** (`/assess`): Added `print:overflow-visible` and `print:min-w-0` to
  prevent right-column clipping in the PDF.

## [1.14.0] - 2026-02-19

### Added

- **Industry-Aware Assessment Wizard** (`/assess`): Compliance, crypto usage, use case, and
  infrastructure steps now surface industry-relevant options first based on CSV-driven config
  (`pqcassessment_02192026.csv`). Industry-specific threats appendix included in report.
- **Country Compliance Filtering** (`/assess`): Step 5 (Compliance) filters frameworks by the
  selected country/jurisdiction — only globally-applicable and country-relevant frameworks are shown.
- **PDF Print Support** (`/assess`): Full print-optimized report with repeating header
  (app version, industry, country, date) and footer (assess URL, page number). Includes
  `break-inside: avoid` on sections, light-mode forced variables, `print-color-adjust: exact`
  for background colors, and framer-motion suppression.
- **Report Collapsible Sections** (`/assess`): Country PQC Migration Timeline and Industry Threat
  Landscape are collapsible on screen but always expanded in print via `hidden print:block` pattern.
- **Organization Filter** (`/library`): Replaced the Region dropdown with an Organization filter
  (NIST, IETF, ETSI, ISO, BSI, ANSSI, etc.) using a canonical org map that rolls up sub-groups.

### Fixed

- **Share URL Arrays** (`/assess`): `dataSensitivity` and `dataRetention` now correctly encode as
  comma-joined arrays in the share URL; added `cy` (country) parameter.
- **PDF Dark Mode** (`/assess`): Print CSS forces all semantic color variables to light-mode values,
  preventing invisible text on white paper when dark theme is active.
- **PDF Background Colors** (`/assess`): Added `print-color-adjust: exact` so bar graphs, badges,
  and colored elements render in the PDF instead of being stripped by the browser.
- **PDF Page Breaks** (`/assess`): `glass-panel` sections avoid splitting across pages; Threat
  Landscape starts on a fresh page; trailing blank page eliminated via `min-height: 0`.
- **Timeline Label Clipping** (`/assess`): Edge year labels (2024, 2035) use left/right-aligned
  transforms instead of centered, preventing clipping in the report timeline strip.

### Changed

- **Mobile Walkthrough** (`GuidedTour`): Redesigned the guided tour on mobile as a full-screen
  swipeable card carousel with step icons, dot indicators, and drag gestures. Desktop anchored
  tooltips unchanged. Added `?tour` query param to reset and replay the tour.
- **WhatsNew Toast** (`WhatsNewToast`): Centered on mobile (was fixed bottom-right, overflowed on
  narrow screens). Added `?whatsnew` query param for easy testing.
- **Assessment Report** (`/assess`): "Explore" links and action buttons hidden in print. Cross-industry
  threats section removed from report — only industry-specific threats shown.

## [1.13.0] - 2026-02-18

### Added

- **Risk Assessment Country Picker** (`/assess`): New "Country" step (step 2 of 13) lets
  organizations select their jurisdiction; the selection aligns the Timeline step with real
  regulatory deadlines sourced directly from the PQC Gantt timeline data.
- **Multi-select Data Sensitivity** (`/assess`): Organizations can now select multiple sensitivity
  levels simultaneously (Low / Medium / High / Critical). Risk scoring uses the highest selected
  level; useful for organizations managing data of mixed sensitivity.
- **Multi-select Data Retention** (`/assess`): Multiple retention periods can be selected at once.
  HNDL risk is computed against the longest selected period for accurate worst-case assessment.
- **Country-aligned Migration Deadlines** (`/assess`): The Timeline step surfaces Deadline phases
  from the selected country's Gantt timeline (real years, titles, descriptions) instead of generic
  static options. Falls back gracefully when no country-specific deadlines exist.
- **Wizard Reset Button** (`/assess`): A "Reset" button in the wizard navigation footer clears all
  answers and returns to step 1, providing a quick path to restart without navigating away.

### Fixed

- **Assessment Store Schema Migration** (`/assess`): Persisted assessments from v1.12 and earlier
  stored `dataSensitivity` and `dataRetention` as strings. On rehydration these are now
  automatically upgraded to arrays, preventing a `TypeError: .filter is not a function` crash.

### Changed

- **Risk Assessment Wizard** (`/assess`): Expanded from 12 to 13 steps with the Country picker.
  `AssessmentInput.dataSensitivity` and `.dataRetention` are now `string[]`; the scoring engine
  uses `getMaxSensitivity()` and `getMaxRetentionYears()` helpers — fully backward-compatible.

## [1.12.0] - 2026-02-18

### Added

- **Timeline Document Table** (`/timeline`): Selecting a country from the Country filter now
  reveals a document table below the Gantt chart listing all matching phases and milestones
  with organization, phase badge, type, title, period (year range), description, and source link.

### Fixed

- **Timeline Filter UX** (`/timeline`):
  - Renamed "Region" dropdown label to "Country" for clarity
  - Active filter chips with × dismiss now appear below the filter bar for every active filter
    (country, phase type, event type, and text search)
  - Result count shown alongside chips ("N results · X of Y countries")
  - Empty state with "Clear all filters" action when no results match
  - Country dropdown now renders above the sticky Gantt table headers (z-index fix)

## [1.11.0] - 2026-02-17

### Added

- **PQC Quiz Module** (`/learn`): New interactive quiz in the Learning dashboard covering
  post-quantum cryptography fundamentals, algorithm families, and migration concepts.

### Fixed

- **Compliance page UI/UX** (`/compliance`):
  - Renamed ambiguous "CC" column header to "Classic" (was misread as Common Criteria)
  - Added missing BSI (DE) source card so the authoritative-sources grid is complete
  - Unified all four filter active states to `primary` color (was: accent, secondary, warning, tertiary)
  - Loading overlay now correctly reads "Refreshing Data…" during a refresh vs. "Filtering Records…" during filtering
  - Close button in detail modal replaced with `<X>` icon + `aria-label`; focus moves into modal on open
  - Filter backdrop `role="button"` replaced with `aria-hidden="true"`
  - Empty-state `colSpan` corrected from 10 to 8
  - ShareButton/GlossaryButton now visible at `md` breakpoint (was `lg`-only)

- **Guided Tour** (`/`): Fixed mobile portrait layout blocking tour from completing;
  fixed tooltip position jumping on step transitions.

    - 4 category sub-scores (Quantum Exposure, Migration Complexity, Regulatory Pressure, Organizational Readiness)
    - Weighted composite with interaction multipliers (HNDL, compliance urgency, migration difficulty)
    - Full backward compatibility — old 5-field assessments produce identical scores
  - **HNDL Risk Window visualization**: SVG timeline showing data retention vs. estimated quantum threat horizon (2035)
  - **Migration effort estimation**: Per-algorithm complexity rating (quick-win, moderate, major-project, multi-year)

### Changed

- **Color System Standardization**:
  - Migrated all remaining hardcoded Tailwind colors to semantic tokens across Algorithms, Landing, and data files
  - `blue-500` → `primary`, `green-500` → `success`, `yellow-500` → `warning`, `red-500` → `destructive`

- **Navigation**:
  - Reordered nav items with Assess prominently placed
