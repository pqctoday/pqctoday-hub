- **Cryptography**:
  - OpenSSL WASM v3.6.2 (with native ML-KEM, ML-DSA, and LMS/HSS support)
  - `@pqctoday/softhsm-wasm` v0.4.18 — SoftHSMv3 PKCS#11 v3.2 WASM; C++ engine v0.4.18 (ML-KEM, ML-DSA, SLH-DSA, AES, PBKDF2, HKDF, KBKDF, EdDSA, secp256k1, X25519, BIP32); Rust engine v0.4.18 (PKCS#11 v3.2 KEM compliance, CKA_PARAMETER_SET flags, wasm-bindgen 0.2.117)
  - `@oqs/liboqs-js` for additional PQC algorithms (FrodoKEM, HQC, Classic McEliece)

node scripts/generate-infographics.mjs --all
```

## Architecture Overview

The application is structured into several key components:

- **`src/components/Playground`**: The core interactive component allowing users to generate keys, sign/verify messages, and encapsulate/decapsulate secrets.
- **`src/wasm`**: TypeScript wrappers for WebAssembly cryptographic libraries (`liboqs`, ML-KEM, ML-DSA, LMS). `softhsm/` provides the Phase 6 PKCS#11 singleton loader and modular sub-modules; `inspect/` decodes PKCS#11 call parameters for the call log.
- **`src/components/OpenSSLStudio`**: A simulated OpenSSL workbench for advanced users.
- **`src/components/PKILearning`**: Educational platform with 49 modules across 8 tracks — foundations, strategy, protocols, infrastructure, applications, industries, role guides, and executive.
- **`src/components/Assess`**: 14-step industry-aware risk assessment wizard with compound scoring engine, consolidated HNDL/HNFL risk analysis, and PDF print support.
- **`src/components/Migrate`**: Comprehensive PQC migration planning module with verified software database and workflow guidance.
- **`src/components/common/Glossary.tsx`**: Global floating PQC glossary panel.
- **`src/components/common/GuidedTour.tsx`**: Interactive first-visit onboarding tour.
- **`src/services/crypto/OpenSSLService.ts`**: Primary cryptographic service wrapping OpenSSL WASM operations.
- **`src/store`**: Zustand state stores for theme, learning progress, assessment (proxy delegating to form + result sub-stores), TLS simulation, version tracking, persona, compliance selection, endorsements, bookmarks, and disclaimer (all persisted to localStorage).
- **`src/data`**: Static data layer — TypeScript data files, versioned CSV files (timelines, leaders, library, software references), X.509 certificate profiles, and ACVP test vectors. `csvUtils.ts` provides a shared date-stamped / revision-sorted CSV loader used by all data modules.
- **`src/utils`**: Utility functions for data conversion and common operations.

## Security

Last audited: March 22, 2026

| Severity | Production | Dev-only |
| -------- | ---------- | -------- |
| Critical | 0          | 0        |
| High     | 0          | 5        |
| Moderate | 0          | 1        |

All runtime/production dependencies have **zero known CVEs**. The 6 dev-only findings are confined to the ESLint linting toolchain (`minimatch` ReDoS) and do not affect the deployed application. Full resolution requires ESLint 9→10 major bump (tracked). See the [About page](/about) for full SBOM and CVE details.
