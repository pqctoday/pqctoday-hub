    (US/France/Canada 2030, Germany/UK/Australia 2035) instead of a universal planning horizon

    frameworks — imminent deadlines score higher than distant ones

    data/credential expiry dates with at-risk/safe badges) plus individual timeline visualizations; risk windows
    render with industry-aware conservative estimates when users select "I don't know"
  - Per-algorithm migration effort estimation (quick-win to multi-year)
  - **Quick/Comprehensive badge** in report header — clearly identifies the depth of the completed assessment
  - **HNDL warning banner**: quick assessments with high or critical sensitivity display a banner noting that
    Harvest-Now-Decrypt-Later risk was not quantified and recommending a comprehensive assessment
  - Executive summary generated for both quick and comprehensive assessments; category breakdowns and
    URL-shareable assessments for comprehensive mode; URL-hydrated parameters validated against canonical
    allowlists to prevent injection of arbitrary values via shared links
  - Enhanced CSV export with effort ratings and rationale
  - Industry-aware wizard: compliance, crypto, use-case, and infrastructure steps prioritize industry-relevant options
  - Country compliance filtering: frameworks filtered by selected jurisdiction
  - PDF/print support: downloadable report with header/footer, page numbers, and section-aware page breaks

  wizard. Accepts URL query parameters to auto-hydrate and auto-complete assessments from a shared
  link. Includes all report sections: Risk Score gauge, Category Breakdown, HNDL/HNFL risk windows,
  Algorithm Migration priorities, Recommended Actions, Migration Roadmap (with MigrationToolkit
  product suggestions), and Threat Landscape. Google Drive cloud sync enables uploading/downloading
  full-app progress snapshots to the Drive `appDataFolder` (hidden from the user's file list,
  access-token stored in-memory only).

  - Category filters, A-Z index, full-text search
  - Complexity badges (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)
  - Cross-references to learning modules
  - **Inline tooltips** on key terms throughout all 18 learning modules — portal-rendered with
    `position: fixed` so they always appear above overflow-constrained containers (modals,
    scrollable panels, diagram wrappers)
- **Personalization System**: Role, region, and industry picker on the home page that adapts the
  entire application to the user's context
  - **Role picker**: Executive/CISO, Developer/Engineer, Security Architect, Researcher/Academic —
    ordered by access breadth; unified order across home page and Learn page
  - **Persona-driven navigation**: irrelevant pages hidden from nav; always-visible pages (Home,
    Learn, Timeline, Threats, About) remain accessible to all. Each persona's nav is tuned:
    Executive includes Compliance and Migrate; Developer includes Assess; Architect includes
    Playground
  - **"For you" badges**: landing page cards highlight the top 3 recommended pages per role;
    inferred persona badge appears on home page role picker after assessment completion
  - **Persona-aware hero CTAs**: primary and secondary landing page actions adapt to the selected
    role (Executive → Assess, Developer → Playground, Architect → Timeline, Researcher → Algorithms)
  - **Journey step rail**: landing page features a horizontal 7-step progression (Learn → Assess →
    Explore → Test → Deploy → Ramp Up → Stay Agile); steps inaccessible to the active persona are
    dimmed; persona-priority steps receive "For you" badges; each card shows route chips for all
    available paths
  - **Persona inference**: assessment results map to all four personas using correct field values;
    returns null when signal is insufficient rather than defaulting to Architect
  - **Region pre-seeding**: pre-filters Timeline and pre-seeds Assessment country on mount
  - **Industry pre-seeding**: pre-seeds Assessment industry, pre-filters Threats and Library,
    highlights relevant Learn modules with "Relevant" badges

## Security

Last audited: February 23, 2026

| Severity | Production | Dev-only |
| -------- | ---------- | -------- |
| Critical | 0          | 0        |

All runtime/production dependencies have **zero known CVEs**. The 6 dev-only findings are confined to the ESLint linting toolchain (`minimatch` ReDoS) and do not affect the deployed application. Full resolution requires ESLint 9→10 major bump (tracked). See the [About page](/about) for full SBOM and CVE details.
