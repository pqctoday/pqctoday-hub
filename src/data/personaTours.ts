 * Short role tours — B+ remediation 4.2 (2026-08-10); GRC's added 2026-09-07.
 *
 * Onboarding carried exactly one role out of six properly. Executive has a real
 * eight-phase guided tour (`EXEC_TOUR_STAGES` in the simulation) and curious has
 * a four-step guide (`CuriousGuide`); developer, architect, researcher and ops
 * got the same generic feature deck as an anonymous visitor, plus a disclaimer.
 * GRC — new as of the 2026-09-07 Executive/GRC split — had no tour at all
 * until it was added here, for the same reason.
 *
 * These are deliberately SHORT — four steps, each pointing at a surface that
 * already exists, ending somewhere the reader has done something rather than
 * read something. "Each tour is a few screens against a surface that already
 * exists" is the whole design; anything longer would be a second product.
 *
 * They render as a final phase of the existing `GuidedTour` modal, reusing its
 * slide shape, its keyboard handling and its completion storage. No new tour
 * machinery was built.
 *
 * Every `route` here is validated against `App.tsx`'s real route set by
 * `personaTours.test.ts` — a tour that ends on a 404 is worse than no tour.
