/**
 * Shared "recommended start sequence" for the Business Center, per persona.
 *
 * Before the 2026-09-07 Executive/GRC split, every Business Center surface
 * (BusinessToolsGrid's "Start with the essentials" banner, BusinessCenterView
 * and MobileCommandCenterView's WelcomeState "top tools") hard-coded the SAME
 * generic, executive-flavored tool sequence and showed it to every visitor
 * regardless of persona — a developer or a curious visitor saw "Business
 * case → Risk → Governance → Roadmap → Verify" with no connection to their
 * own path. This file centralizes the two sequences the split plan calls
 * out explicitly (executive-grc-split-plan.md §D) so every consumer reads
 * the same data instead of re-typing it with the risk of drifting apart.
 *
 * Every tool id here is validated against `businessToolsRegistry.tsx` by
 * `businessRoleConfig.test.ts` — a typo'd id fails the build, not silently
 * renders a missing card.
