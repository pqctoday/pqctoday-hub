/**
 * PQC Protocol Support Matrix — 30 protocol rows (IETF, TCG, OASIS, 3GPP, IEEE,
 * ANSI/INCITS, UEFI, and vendor-published specs) × release / draft / 4 PQC
 * dimensions / OSS libs / playground.
 *
 * Snapshot date: see PROTOCOL_MATRIX_LAST_UPDATED below — this header comment
 * is not kept in sync automatically; treat the constant as authoritative.
 *
 * The 4 dimensions reflect the published external PQC-readiness heatmap:
 *  - pureKem   = pure post-quantum KEM (e.g. ML-KEM-only, no classical fallback)
 *  - hybridKem = PQ + classical KEM concatenation (ML-KEM component encoded
 *                FIRST per composite-kem §4.1; TLS named groups use their own
 *                wire order, e.g. X25519MLKEM768)
 *  - pureSig   = pure PQ signature/auth (e.g. ML-DSA-only, SLH-DSA-only)
 *  - hybridSig = PQ + classical composite signature (ML-DSA component encoded
 *                FIRST per composite-sigs §4.3, raw concatenation, no ASN.1 wrapper)
 *
 * Dimension status values (coarse — kept for backwards compatibility and as
 * the heatmap fallback when `stage` is absent):
 *  - 'rfc'          published RFC / TCG release / ITU-T edition
 *  - 'draft'        active IETF / TCG draft
 *  - 'experimental' non-IETF or expired draft / vendor pre-standard
 *  - 'none'         not specified, not pursued
 *  - 'na'           not applicable for this protocol family
 *
 * DraftStage — finer 0–7 scale aligned with the OFFICIAL IETF progression
 * (earliest → latest). The 8-shade heatmap makes two adjacent pairs share a
 * colour tier (WG-doc/WG-LC, and IESG/RFC-Ed-queue); the per-cell IETF-stage
 * tooltip spells out all seven official steps distinctly.
 *  - 'none'              0  no plan / no work
 *  - 'identified'        1  problem flagged, not yet on the standards track
 *  - 'experimental'      2  off-track: expired draft / non-IETF / vendor pre-standard
 *  - 'individual-draft'  3  step 1 — individual Internet-Draft
 *  - 'wg-document'       4  step 2 — WG-adopted document
 *  - 'wg-last-call'      4  step 3 — WG Last Call
 *  - 'ietf-last-call'    5  step 4 — IETF Last Call (community-wide review)
 *  - 'iesg-submitted'    6  step 5 — IESG review / telechat (AFTER IETF Last Call)
 *  - 'rfc-editor-queue'  6  step 6 — Approved; in the RFC Editor publication queue
 *  - 'rfc-published'     7  step 7 — published RFC / final spec
 *  - 'na'                0  not applicable for this dimension
 *
 * When `stage` is populated, the matrix renders a graduated heatmap (PQCC-style)
 * instead of the 5-bucket coarse coloring. The coarse `value` must remain
 * consistent with the finer `stage` (validated by scripts/audit-matrix-refs.ts).
 *
 * Playground testability values (per existing tool in /playground):
 *  - 'full'    user can select / exercise this dimension in the tool
 *  - 'partial' supported via backend / URL param but not exposed in UI
 *  - 'none'    not supported by the tool
 *  - 'na'      dimension not applicable to this protocol

Signature sizes (ML-DSA 2.4–4.6 KB, SLH-DSA 7.8–49.8 KB) blow past the ~1232-byte DNS UDP limit, forcing TCP fallback. Resolver compatibility studies (SIDN Labs on .nl/.se/.nu zones) find roughly half of Internet resolvers fail when zones carry unknown algorithms. Verisign's Merkle Tree Ladder (MTL) mode draft and IETF 123/124 Hackathon work (BIND, NSD, CoreDNS extensions) are all lab/R&D — no live DNSSEC zone has been signed with PQ today. Verisign estimates the next root-zone algorithm rollover (mid-2030s) is the realistic deployment window.",
