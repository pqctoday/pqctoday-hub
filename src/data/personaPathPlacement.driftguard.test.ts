// Driftguard for persona-path PLACEMENT — the half of discoverability that
// `moduleRegistration.test.ts` cannot see.
//
// That guard asks "is this module in *a* path?". B+ remediation WS8 (2026-08-21)
// established that membership alone is not the contract, because two consumers
// navigate by array INDEX, not by membership:
//
//   - `PKILearning/common/CuriousModuleView.tsx` — Previous/Next Module buttons
//     do `const idx = path.indexOf(moduleId)` then `path[idx - 1]`/`path[idx + 1]`.
//   - `PKILearning/PersonaPathView.tsx`'s `computeNextIncompleteModuleId` — walks
//     `pathItems` in order for the "Continue where you left off" card.
//   (`NextModuleCTA.tsx` does the same index walk and is what WS8's brief named,
//   but it is mounted nowhere today — ModuleShell's P2.3 footer replaced it with a
//   trackOrder-based handoff. Kept in the reasoning because the contract is the
//   same the moment anything re-mounts it.)
//
// `recommendedPath` arrays run 19-52 entries and always end in `'quiz'`, so a
// module appended just before `'quiz'` is only ever offered as "next" to a
// learner who has already finished the entire curriculum ahead of it — membership
// on paper, zero reach in practice. WS17's signals-to-score analysis measured the
// same thing from the other end: binary signal COUNT does not predict
// discoverability (r = -0.008 across 9 mechanisms); reach and position do.
//
// So this file pins three things a future edit could silently undo:
//   1. no learn module is orphaned from every path (floor, no escape hatch here);
//   2. the modules WS8 reinstated keep >= 2 personas AND their cluster-adjacent
//      insertion slots — not a tail append;
//   3. the set of single-path modules can shrink but never grow (ratchet).
//
// A failure here means a persona path was reordered or trimmed in a way that
// re-buries a module, not a bug in this file.
