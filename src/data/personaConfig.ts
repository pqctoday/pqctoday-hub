/**
 * Persona-aware "Practice in the Simulation" CTA — which migration phases each
 * profile actually practices in the sim. A Learn module shows the CTA when the
 * active persona practices that module's `frameworkPhase` (the sim climbs the
 * same phases p0–p7 + verify-close, and every module carries one).
 *
 * Linked to `ROLE_CROSSWALK`/`personaToRoles` (`roleCrosswalk.ts`), which is the
 * source of truth for which phases a seat actually *owns* in-sim (spec §7).
 * Every set below is the union of that persona's owned phases, so the CTA can
 * never point a player at a phase their seat doesn't own — the exact drift the
 * two-vocabulary split used to allow (07082026 remediation, simulation.md item
 * 2). `executive` carries phases beyond its owned set as a documented,
 * deliberate exception: the Executive Overview tour (`execTourConfig.ts`
 * `EXEC_TOUR_STAGES`) genuinely walks the exec persona through p1/p2/p3
 * content (data-asset-sensitivity, CBOM, risk-register) for board-oversight
 * framing, even though `crypto-architect` drives them programmatically. The
 * 2026-09-07 Executive/GRC split (executive-grc-split-plan.md §5) moved
 * `qrpm`/`vendor-lead`/`pmo-analyst` off `executive` onto the new `grc`
 * persona as the nearest operational governance learning persona, so
 * executive's ROLE_CROSSWALK-owned set shrank to `exec-sponsor`'s `p0` alone
 * — p4/p7/verify-close/foundations are now ALSO beyond-ownership exceptions
 * here, not owned phases, even though this list (and the tour) is unchanged.
 * This is an educational-recommendation change, not a change to gate
 * authority — see `roleCrosswalk.ts`. The drift guard in
 * `personaConfig.test.ts` pins this relationship (owned ⊆ set, extras ⊆
 * allowlist) so it can't silently drift further.
 *
 * B+ remediation 2.5 (2026-08-10) — the broad fallback is REVERSED for the two
 * personas that have no phase set. Showing "Practice in the Simulation" on
 * every single module for researcher and curious was a call to action for a
 * migration neither of them is running; a prompt on everything is a prompt on
 * nothing. `PERSONA_SIM_PRACTICE_NONE` below names them explicitly (rather
 * than leaving it to `undefined`, which cannot distinguish "no mapping yet"
 * from "deliberately none"), and `personaPracticesModulePhase` returns false
 * for them. `null` (no persona chosen) keeps the broad fallback — we know
 * nothing about that visitor, so we suppress nothing.

/**
 * One of the three board options a role can be shown, with the grounding that
 * justifies it existing.
 *
 * The three options per role are the top three use cases for that role in
 * supporting a PQC migration, drawn from the Simulation's own phase vocabulary
 * (`frameworkPhases.ts`) and cross-checked against `BC_ZONE_EMPHASIS_BY_PERSONA`.
 * `curious` is the deliberate exception: that persona is not running a
 * migration, so its three are entry points and carry no `phaseId`/`cswp39Zone`
 * — forcing the phase axis onto it would invent a use case it does not have.
 *
 * A board carries whichever tools genuinely fit its use case and role — a
 * business tool, a playground workshop, or one of each. Neither kind is
 * mandatory and neither is used by more than one board.
 *
 * ALLOCATION PRIORITY (set 2026-08-02). No destination may serve two boards,
 * so two boards wanting the same tool is a conflict that needs a rule rather
 * than a coin toss. Resolve in this order:
 *
 *   1. DEVELOPER-SPECIFIC RESOURCES GO TO DEVELOPER. Tools whose audience is
 *      someone writing code — OpenSSL Studio, the JWT workshop, the hybrid KEM
 *      pipeline, the cert calculator, and the developer-facing business tools —
 *      are developer's regardless of anything below.
 *   2. Otherwise, first claim in this order wins:
 *        curious > developer > ops > architect > researcher > executive
 *      Curious leads because it is the entry persona: a first-time visitor gets
 *      the single most legible tool, and if that board fails to land, the other
 *      seventeen never get read. Researcher and executive rank last because
 *      they have the most substitutes — the corpus and the business-tool shelf
 *      both offer several equally good options for any given board.
 *
 * Worked example: curious/break and developer/pilot both wanted the TLS 1.3
 * simulator. Rule 1 does not apply (a protocol demo is not developer-only), so
 * rule 2 gives it to curious, and developer/pilot took the hybrid KEM pipeline
 * — which is the more developer-specific tool anyway.
 *
 * `moduleIds`, `workshopIds` and `businessToolIds` are not decoration. A priv-side validator
 * asserts every workshop id is a real `workshopRegistry.tsx` entry and every
 * module id sits on THAT ROLE's own `recommendedPath` — which is what makes
 * "relevant for this role" a check rather than a claim.

/* ── Executive side card: Mosca exposure window ──────────────────────────────
 *
 * WHY THESE ARE DERIVED (2026-08-02). All four values on this card — the three
 * rows and the punchline — were hand-typed literals in the CSV, and the
 * punchline had drifted out of agreement with its own rows: it read "You are
 * four years short" above "Data must stay secret 12 yrs / Your migration takes
 * 5 yrs / Cryptanalytic quantum computer 2032 ±4". Mosca's inequality on those
 * numbers gives 11, not 4. ("Four" is what 12 would have been if the secrecy
 * figure were still 5, which is the likeliest history.) A literal conclusion
 * sitting above literal premises cannot be kept honest by review alone, so the
 * conclusion is now computed from the premises.
 *
 * The CRQC year is no longer a literal either. It comes from
 * `getCrqcConsensus()` — the single place the Threats page reduces its six
 * sourced `CRQC_ESTIMATES` rows to headline numbers, which every Q-Day figure
 * on that page already calls so they agree by construction. Its current output
 * (zEstimate 2033, consensus window 2030–2036) does not match the card's old
 * hand-typed "2032 ±4" either, and the old footnote's "median across 4
 * published expert surveys ... interquartile range" misdescribed both the
 * source count and the derivation.
 *
 * The punchline is expressed as a START-BY YEAR rather than a countdown from
 * "now" deliberately: a `Date.now()`-dependent string would make the generated
 * board differ every day and turn the CSV-vs-generated drift gate permanently
 * red. A fixed year is stable, derived, and the more actionable number for the
 * reader anyway.
 *
 * That start-by year is `z - x - y`, NOT `z - y`. This was wrong until
 * 2026-08-02: it computed `z - y` (2033 - 5 = 2028), which drops x — the
 * secrecy requirement — and so is not Mosca's inequality at all, merely
 * "finish as the machine arrives". It also contradicted this app's other
 * implementation of the same formula: SectorExposureHero.tsx computes
 * `z - dataLife - MIGRATION_YEARS` and shows its working on screen
 * ("Z 2033 − X 12 − Y 5"), so the two surfaces disagreed by 12 years on the
 * same question from the same inputs. Finishing as the machine arrives
 * protects nothing already encrypted under a 12-year requirement, which is
 * why the old punchline had to append "or your 12-year secrets are already
 * late" — a clause conceding the conclusion its own number denied.
 *
 * Whether that year is behind us is decided against `EXEC_MOSCA_AS_OF_YEAR`, a
 * DECLARED constant rather than the wall clock, for the same drift-gate reason
 * as above. It is NOT in FRESHNESS_CLAIMS — that registry requires a live
 * source URL to re-verify against, and "what year is it" has none. A unit test
 * asserts it stays within a year of the real clock instead.
