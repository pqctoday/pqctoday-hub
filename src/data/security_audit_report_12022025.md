# Security Audit Report

**Date:** 2025-12-02
**Auditor:** Antigravity

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive security audit was conducted on the PQC Timeline Application codebase. The audit included automated dependency scanning and manual static code analysis. **No high or critical vulnerabilities were found.** The codebase follows security best practices for the identified scope.

## 1. Dependency Analysis

- **Tool**: `npm audit`
- **Status**: ✅ **Passed**
- **Findings**: 0 vulnerabilities found in project dependencies.

## 2. Static Code Analysis

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

- **Check**: Searched for `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` and unescaped user input.
- **Status**: ✅ **Passed**
- **Findings**: No instances of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` were found. React's default escaping is effectively used.

### Code Injection

- **Check**: Searched for `eval()`, `new Function()`, and other execution sinks.
- **Status**: ✅ **Passed**
- **Findings**: No dangerous execution functions were found.

### External Links (Tabnabbing)

- **Check**: Verified that all `target="_blank"` links include `rel="noopener noreferrer"`.
- **Status**: ✅ **Passed**
- **Findings**: All external links in the following components are correctly secured:
  - `src/components/Timeline/GanttDetailPopover.tsx`
  - `src/components/Leaders/LeadersGrid.tsx`
  - `src/components/Library/LibraryDetailPopover.tsx`
  - `src/components/Library/LibraryTreeTable.tsx`

### Data Storage

- **Check**: Analyzed usage of `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`.
- **Status**: ℹ️ **Note**
- **Findings**:
  - `src/components/Playground/contexts/SettingsProvider.tsx` uses `sessionStorage` to persist playground execution modes and enabled algorithms.
  - **Risk**: Low. This data is non-sensitive user preference data.
  - **Recommendation**: Ensure no sensitive PII or cryptographic keys are ever stored in `sessionStorage` in the future.

### Hardcoded Secrets

- **Check**: Searched for patterns like "API_KEY", "SECRET", "TOKEN", "PASSWORD".
- **Status**: ✅ **Passed**
- **Findings**:
  - "Secret" keywords found in `src/wasm/` files refer to variable names for cryptographic operations (e.g., `secretKey`), which is expected behavior for this application.
  - "Secret" keywords in CSV files refer to public URLs or threat descriptions (e.g., "AWS Secrets Manager").
  - No actual hardcoded credentials were identified.

## Recommendations

1.  **Continuous Monitoring**: Integrate `npm audit` into the CI/CD pipeline to catch new dependency vulnerabilities early.
2.  **CSP**: Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) header in the deployment configuration to further mitigate XSS risks.
3.  **Secret Management**: Continue to ensure that any future backend integration uses environment variables for secrets, not hardcoded values.
