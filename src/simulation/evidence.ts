 * wrote the same "done", into GLOBAL stores shared with Learn. An automated
 * walkthrough could therefore complete a learner's curriculum, and any document
 * of a matching TYPE — whoever made it, for whatever organisation — cleared a
 * gate.
 *
 * The model here keeps four things apart:
 *   - WHAT was touched          → `kind` + `resourceId`
 *   - HOW FAR the learner got   → `status`
 *   - WHO/WHAT produced it      → `origin`
 *   - WHICH WORLD it belongs to → `runId` + `fingerprint`
 *
 * Nothing in this file is a claim about a real organisation. A simulated record
 * describes an exercise, never a verified state.
