/**
 * runMetrics (W2.5) — the measurable conditions a maturity criterion states.
 *
 * Most of the framework's L2–L4 indicators describe an operating CONDITION, not
 * a document: "Year 1 budget secured", "≥70% Tier-1 coverage", "2+ production
 * pilots running with measured results", "Top 10 vendors formally engaged".
 * Producing an artifact about a condition is not the same as reaching it, which
 * is why those bands were honestly recorded as proxies.
 *
 * A `measure` step names one of these metrics and a threshold taken from the
 * criterion's own wording. The value is read out of real run state, so the band
 * evidences the condition itself.
 *
 * Rules this file exists to enforce:
 *  - An UNKNOWN metric id returns null and never completes a step. A criterion
 *    we cannot measure must fail closed, not silently pass.
 *  - Thresholds live in the trees next to the criterion they came from, not
 *    here, so a reader can check one against the other.
