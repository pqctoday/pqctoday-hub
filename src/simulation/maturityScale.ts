 *
 * SCENARIO COMPLETION is how much of what this simulation actually offers the
 * player has finished. It is legitimate and useful (a fully-cleared short phase
 * IS 100% of that phase's available exercises), but it is a completion
 * percentage, not a maturity level, and must never be displayed as one.
 *
 * The defect this replaces: `normalizeLevel` stretched a short ladder onto 0–4
 * and the result was fed into PROGRAM MATURITY. P3 ships bands L1–L2, so a
 * player at P3 L2 was reported at framework level 4 — the framework's own L3
 * ("QRA updated quarterly… legal risk dimension assessed") and L4 ("continuous
 * risk posture management… integrated into enterprise risk register and audit
 * cycle") were simply skipped, and the comment claiming the framework caps
 * these phases was wrong: the framework has L1–L4 indicators for every phase,
 * the IMPLEMENTATION has a shorter activity ladder.
