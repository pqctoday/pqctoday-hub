/**
 * Migration readiness (WS-04) — grounded in the estate, gated by two locks.
 *
 * An estate edge counts as MIGRATED only when BOTH gates pass:
 *   1. Effort   — the player has completed enough P5 activities to "unlock" it
 *                 (activity gate: floor(p5Frac × migratableEdges)).
 *   2. Judgment — the player has chosen a sound strategy (hybrid/pure) for it
 *                 (decision gate: edgeDecisions[edgeKey] ∈ {hybrid, pure}).
 * Neither gate alone moves the score — a choice on paper with no work, or work
 * with no choice, both count for nothing.
 *
 * The denominator is ALL vulnerable edges, so residual edges (no PQC path,
 * vendor-dependent, or touching a product with no PQC story) permanently hold
 * readiness below 100% — the intended supply-chain pressure.
 *
 * Strategy alignment is a SEPARATE meter: a `pure` choice where the jurisdiction
 * requires `hybrid` still counts as migrated (it is quantum-safe) but lowers
 * alignment. It reports what it actually evaluated — an unknown jurisdiction or
 * a run with no decisions yields `null`, never a perfect score.
 *
 * Pure function (no React); the caller supplies the P5 completion fraction, the
 * persisted per-edge decisions, and the org's country.
