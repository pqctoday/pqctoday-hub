 * runScore (WP4.2) — grades a completed (or in-progress) run A–D from four
 * independently-visible sub-scores, not a black box: pace against a
 * difficulty-adjusted par, how many traps were picked THIS run (the lifetime
 * tally in simTrapTally.ts is a separate, cross-run instrument — this is
 * run-scoped so a past run's mistakes never colour a fresh one), estate
 * compliance (readiness.ts's compliancePct), and how many transformation
 * objectives landed on schedule (transformationStatus.ts's objectives).
 *
 * W4: the alignment component is NULLABLE. When nothing was evaluated (no
 * decisions made, or no jurisdiction rule on file) it is dropped from the
 * average rather than counted as a perfect 100 — scoring an unevaluated run as
 * fully aligned is the same "absence of evidence reads as success" defect the
 * readiness meter had.
 *
 * Pure function — no React, no store reads. The caller supplies every input.
