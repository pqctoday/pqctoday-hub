/**
 * personaDebrief (W7.4) — what this run means for the seat the player sat in.
 *
 * The run-end ceremony said the same thing to everyone: a grade, a maturity
 * number and three objectives. That is a sponsor's view, and it left an
 * architect without their technical evidence, an operator without a cadence,
 * and a newcomer without a plain-language explanation of what they just saw.
 *
 * Two things are kept apart on purpose, because the audit found them conflated:
 *  - SPONSORSHIP (funding, ownership, risk acceptance, sequencing) — the
 *    executive question.
 *  - ASSURANCE (applicability, evidence gaps, review cadence, exceptions) — the
 *    governance question, which is not answered by having a sponsor.
 *
 * Nothing here claims competence. A debrief describes what the run
 * demonstrated and what the seat still owes; it never asserts the player can
 * now do it. Clicks are not competence.
