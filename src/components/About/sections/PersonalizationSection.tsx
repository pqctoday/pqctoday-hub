 * "How this hub adapts to you" — B+ remediation 1.1 (2026-08-10).
 *
 * Personalisation is the hub's largest mechanic and was, until this section,
 * never explained anywhere. The review traced several relevance penalties on
 * *other* pages back to that one comprehension gap: a reader who does not know
 * the site reshapes itself around a declared role reads every narrowing as
 * either arbitrary or broken.
 *
 * Everything on screen here is DERIVED from `personaConfig.ts` via
 * `describePersonaAdaptation` — the same function the persona picker and the
 * rail's absence notices read. That is deliberate and load-bearing: a typed
 * prose description of the gating would drift from the gating within a release
 * (this repo has been burned by typed-conclusion drift twice; see the
 * Mosca-window comment and `mlDsaSignatureBytes`). If the config changes, this
 * page changes with it, or it does not change at all.

        Telling the hub your role changes four things: which pages lead your navigation, which
        sections your report opens on, where the reference pages land on first paint, and which
        progress ladder you climb. It never removes a page from the site — a route you are not
        offered is still reachable by URL, by deep link and from search — and wherever a route is
        deliberately not offered, the navigation says so and why, in place.

          Every record on this site carries a source, a trust tier scored from that source's
          credibility, its peer-review status, its vetting body and whether we hold a copy of the
          document itself. Conclusions are computed from the premises above them rather than typed
          beside them — the risk score, the Mosca window and the signature sizes are all derived, so
          they cannot quietly disagree with their own inputs. Where evidence is missing we mark the
          claim rather than dropping it, and where a source contradicts another we keep both.
