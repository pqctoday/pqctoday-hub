 * and that `null` is load-bearing well outside the rail: `ReportContent.tsx`
 * (`personaPaths === null` → every report section visible) and `GuidedTour.tsx`
 * (`null` → no slide filtering) both branch on it. So we do NOT give researcher
 * a PERSONA_NAV_PATHS array — that would silently gate its report sections and
 * tour slides.
 *
 * What we DO fix here is the rail's *presentation*. Previously an empty FOR YOU
 * dropped researcher into the flat "Everything, unfiltered" + MORE fallback —
 * the same layout a brand-new visitor with no persona gets. Those two cases are
 * genuinely different: no-persona means "we know nothing about you yet", while
 * researcher is an explicit choice that deserves the same grouped
 * Workflow/Practice/Reference rail every other persona gets. So researcher's
 * FOR YOU is the full nav universe, ordered by NAV_PATH_LABELS, and
 * `getForYouGroups` buckets it exactly as it does for everyone else.
 *
 * `null` (no persona yet) keeps the flat fallback — unchanged.
 *
 * The union `forYou ∪ more ∪ RAIL_ALWAYS_VISIBLE_PATHS ∪ RAIL_HIDDEN_PATHS ∪
 * PERSONA_ABSENT_PATHS[persona]` always equals every key in NAV_PATH_LABELS —
 * see railNav.test.ts. The last term is what keeps the coverage invariant true
