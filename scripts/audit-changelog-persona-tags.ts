/**
 * scripts/audit-changelog-persona-tags.ts
 *
 * Makes the `[persona:id]` changelog convention real, going forward.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The /changelog page offers a "For me" filter. Only about 25
 * of ~1,150 entries carry an explicit `[persona:…]` tag, so the overwhelming
 * majority of what that filter returns is a keyword regex GUESS. The 2026-08-10
 * remediation made the control honest — it now states how many results are
 * tagged and how many are guessed — but honesty about a bad ratio does not
 * improve the ratio.
 *
 * The convention itself already exists and is already documented in
 * CHANGELOG.md's own header. What was missing was anything that noticed when a
 * new entry ignored it. This is that.
 *
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO. It does not demand retro-tagging. Nobody
 * can now reconstruct, honestly, which roles a 2025 entry was written for, and
 * a gate that forced someone to guess would manufacture exactly the false
 * precision the "For me" fix removed. So it checks ONLY the most recent release
 * block — the one being written — and every older entry is left alone.
 *
 * That scoping is the whole design: the ratio improves one release at a time,
 * by the only people who can know the answer, at the moment they still know it.
 *
 * Modes:
 *   (default) human-readable report, exit 1 on any untagged entry
 *   --json    machine-readable summary
 *
 * Run via:  npm run audit:changelog-personas
