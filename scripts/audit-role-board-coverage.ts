/**
 * scripts/audit-role-board-coverage.ts
 *
 * Asserts that every section in the coverage contract is reachable from EVERY
 * role's home page.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The 2026-08-09 expansion took the home boards from three
 * use cases per role to six specifically so that each role's home page reaches
 * the whole site. That property was proved once, by hand, in a markdown table.
 * Nothing enforced it afterwards: a later edit could repoint the single link
 * that carried a section for a role and no gate would notice, because every
 * other check still passes — the CTA still resolves, the claim is still fresh,
 * the generated file still matches the CSV. The coverage would just quietly
 * stop being true.
 *
 * It also catches the opposite drift: a NEW section added to the app with no
 * home route at all. That is why `CONTRACT` is asserted against the router
 * below rather than trusted on its own.
 *
 * WHAT COUNTS AS REACHING A SECTION. Any board href — `cta_primary_href`,
 * `cta_secondary_href` or `grid_card_href` — whose path resolves to that
 * section. Learn is additionally satisfied by the track chips, which render as
 * real `/learn/<module>` links on every board.
 *
 * Reads the CSV, not the generated module, for the same reason
 * `audit-role-board-ctas.ts` does: the CSV is what a maintainer edits, so a
 * regression is caught where it is written.
 *
 * Run via: npm run audit:role-board-coverage

 *
 * Added 2026-09-03. Before this existed, ops/suppliers and curious's

 * exact gate, contradicting `PERSONA_ABSENT_PATHS` in `personaConfig.ts` on

 * exemption support"); it had not shipped.
 *
 * Held to the same `EXCEPTION_MAX_AGE_DAYS` freshness window
 * `audit-role-board-literals.ts` uses for its own exceptions, so a reason
 * cannot silently become stale. Checked against `personaConfig.ts` at
 * runtime below (`assertExemptionReasonsAreLive`), not hand-verified once —
