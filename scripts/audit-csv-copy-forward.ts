 *
 * Catches SILENT ROW LOSS between two generations of a dated CSV.
 *
 * THE FAILURE MODE THIS EXISTS FOR (near-miss, 2026-08-14):
 *   This repo versions data as dated generations — library_08122026_r2.csv,
 *   library_08132026.csv, library_08142026.csv — and every loader picks the
 *   NEWEST by (date, revision) and ignores the rest (src/data/csvUtils.ts
 *   sortCSVFiles(), lines 112-143). Two sessions each produced a new
 *   generation: one added two rows to library_08132026.csv, the other wrote
 *   library_08142026.csv from an older base without them. Because the two
 *   generations are DIFFERENT FILENAMES, git merges both cleanly with no
 *   conflict; the app then reads only the newest, and the two rows are gone.
 *   No conflict, no error, no test failure, no signal of any kind. It was
 *   caught by a human asking the right question.
 *
 * THE RULE ENFORCED:
 *   For every dated-CSV family, every ACTIVE row in the previous generation
 *   must still be present in the newest generation — matched by the family's
 *   own primary key. An active row may legitimately CHANGE, and it may
 *   legitimately be DEPRECATED (status=deprecated, which keeps the row), but
 *   it may not simply VANISH. Deletion is not how this repo retires records:
 *   deprecation is (see the status/deprecated_at/deprecated_reason column
 *   triple carried by most families). A row that is already deprecated in the
 *   previous generation is exempt — pruning retired rows is normal.
 *
 *   A genuinely intended removal is expressed by adding an entry to
 *   RECORDED_REMOVALS below, which forces a human to write down a reason.
 *   That is the escape hatch; disabling the gate is not.
 *
 * WHAT IS DERIVED, NOT ASSUMED:
 *   · Families        — by stripping the dated suffix, using the SAME
 *                       csvPrefix() the archival gate already uses.
 *   · Precedence      — delegated to the app's own sortCSVFiles(): date
 *                       DESC, then revision DESC, so library_08132026_r6.csv
 *                       outranks library_08132026.csv and _r24 outranks _r9.
 *   · Primary keys    — derived per family from the data: an identifier-
 *                       looking column, else the shortest leading run of
 *                       columns, that is unique in the previous generation.
 *                       Key names differ wildly across these sources
 *                       (reference_id, product_id, code, Name, href,
 *                       sector_key, and several composites), so nothing is
 *                       hard-coded.
 *   · Active          — from the row's own status/deprecated_at columns when
 *                       the family carries them; active by default otherwise.
 *
 * SCOPE:
 *   Families with at least one generation in src/data/ — i.e. the ones a
 *   loader can actually serve. The PREVIOUS generation may live in
 *   src/data/archive/ (the archival gate keeps only 2 live copies), so both
 *   directories are read. Families that exist only in archive/ are retired
 *   and are not checked. Families whose loader MERGES every generation are
 *   out of scope entirely — see MERGE_ALL_FAMILIES below for why the rule
 *   cannot apply to them.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npx tsx scripts/audit-csv-copy-forward.ts             # human report
 *   npx tsx scripts/audit-csv-copy-forward.ts --verbose   # + per-family detail
 *   npx tsx scripts/audit-csv-copy-forward.ts --json      # machine-readable
 *
 * Exit codes:
 *   0 — every active row in each previous generation survived into the newest
 *   1 — one or more active rows disappeared without a recorded reason

// MERGE-ALL FAMILIES — where the copy-forward rule does not apply at all.
//
// This gate's whole premise is "the app serves only the newest generation", so
// a row absent from it is a row nobody can see. A handful of sources
// deliberately break that premise: their loader globs EVERY dated file (and
// src/data/archive/ too) and merges them, because each run appends a file
// covering DIFFERENT subjects rather than restating the previous one. For
// those, an older generation is not superseded — it is still being served, in
// full, right now. Judging them by copy-forward reports every subject the
// newest run happened not to cover as lost, which is the exact opposite of the
// truth. That false positive was live: on 2026-08-14 this gate reported 166
// active CSWP.39 governance requirements across 26 frameworks (CISA, OMB
// M-26-15, ENISA, CMMC, ...) as lost between the 08-08 and 08-09 generations.
// They were never lost: maturityGovernanceData.ts merges both files, and
// complianceData.test.ts asserts a corpus floor (>100 ref_ids) that the 08-09
// file alone (48) cannot possibly satisfy.
//
// The list is NOT restated here. It is imported from audit-merge-all-coverage's
// own registry — the single place this repo already records "which loaders
// merge every generation", and the gate that fails if one of them stops
// globbing a directory. One truth, two consumers; a new merge-all source
// registered there is picked up here with no second edit.
//
// These families are reported as SKIPPED, never silently dropped: a guard that
// quietly stops checking something is how the loss it guards against returns.

// A file that is GENERATED from other CSVs loses rows for a reason its

// trusted_source_xref_ is the case in point: its generator skips any source row
// whose status is `deprecated` (generate-trusted-source-xref.mjs, added
// 2026-07-16 in bd67d7538, because a deprecated row can share its id field with
// an active one and mint a duplicate composite key). Deprecating a library
// document therefore drops its xref rows BY DESIGN.
//
// Recording those one at a time would mean ~390 hand-written entries that say
// the same sentence, and each new deprecation would break the build until
// someone added another. Worse, the volume would bury the removals that are
// real: of 531 rows this family dropped between its two generations, 390 are
// this rule and 141 are genuine loss. A rule that explains 390 makes those 141
// visible instead of drowning them.
//
// The rule stays deliberately narrow: it excuses a removal ONLY when the target
// row is really gone or really deprecated in the newest generation of the
// source CSV. A dropped xref whose target is still active is still a failure.
